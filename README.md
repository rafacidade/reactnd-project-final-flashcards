## How FlashCards Works

On the home page, the app shows a list of decks. If no decks are listed, the user can add a new deck by pressing the button at the page's bottom, and defining a name for it on the next screen. 

When the user access a deck, he/she can add a new card to it, or start a new quiz.

The quiz screen shows a question and the user has to press "Show Answer" to check if he/she knows the answer. After that, the user has to press the green button (Correct) or the red button (Incorrect), and answer the next card.

By finishing a quiz, the app shows the total of questions and how many of them were set as "Correct".

Once a day the app reminds the user to study by push notification.

## Tests
FlashCards was tested on Android devices (Android 9 and Android 7) and on Expo Snack emulator (Android and iOs)
